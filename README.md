this is my personal little SDK project

its supposed to function sort of like a template/engine that you can import on top of unity to make Ngine based games

think of the marrowSDK but ass

changelog can be viewed once the package is imported through the SDKInfo window

idc about the code that much do what you want, ai wrote about 65% of it anyway
